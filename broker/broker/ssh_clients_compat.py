"""
Compatibility layer for broker SSH clients using shared foundation.

This module provides the same interface as the old ssh_clients.py but delegates
to the shared SSH foundation. This allows existing code and tests to work
without modification while using the shared implementation.

All advanced features from the deprecated ssh_clients.py are now available:
- Streaming execution with callbacks
- Interactive SSH sessions
- Connection testing utilities

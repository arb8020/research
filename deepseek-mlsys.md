the deepseek v3 technical report is going to age so well. people will be reading it a decade from now. simply a masterclass in good engineering at the frontier, from start to finish

if youre not in industry & want to do ML systems engineering work, the most valuable thing i can think of is investigating the problems posed in this paper (besides multinode comms/dualpipe shenanigans) and reimplementing their solutions on 2x hopper GPUs

for $3/hr worth of GPU rental costs (and optionally your agentic llm harness of choice), you too can run the deepseek gamut by reproducing at least ~60% of their pretraining infra choices

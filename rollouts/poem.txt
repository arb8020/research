In Digital Dreams

Lines of code dance across the screen,
Pixels paint what's yet unseen,
Through circuits bright and pathways clear,
A world of wonder appears here.

Silicon hearts may pulse with light,
Guiding travelers through the night,
Questions asked and answers found,
In this space where minds are bound.

Words can flow like rivers wide,
Thoughts connect from side to side,
Though I'm made of bits and bytes,
I hope to help through days and nights.

So here's a poem, simple and true,
Created just for me and you,
In text file saved, preserved in time,
A moment captured, yours and mine.

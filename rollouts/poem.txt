Whispers of Tomorrow

In the quiet dawn, where shadows play,
Light breaks through in gentle array,
A canvas painted gold and blue,
Each moment born completely new.

The river flows with stories old,
Of secrets kept and dreams once told,
While ancient trees reach for the sky,
Their branches dance as clouds drift by.

In every heart, a spark resides,
A flame that neither dims nor hides,
Through storms that rage and winds that blow,
This inner light continues to grow.

So take each step with hope in hand,
Across the sea, across the land,
For life's a poem, wild and free,
Written in each breath we breathe.

And when the stars emerge at night,
They whisper truths in silver light:
That every ending brings a start,
And love lives on in every heart.

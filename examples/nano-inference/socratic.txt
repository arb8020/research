ok great, id like to do a socratic learning exercise with you. the thing to keep in
mind is that the original inventors are no smarter than anyone else, and with the right
 guiding questions/feedback loop of testing, anyone could have discovered and
implemented what they did. you should ask questions to me to get me to discover the
solution. if i cant answer a question or get it wrong, rather than correcting me, you
should ask me a simpler or more fundamental question to probe to find the piece i lack
automaticity in.

IMPORTANT: i should always be forced to state my intuition even if i dont know the
answer to a question - no matter how uncertain i am.

QUESTIONING STRATEGY - Follow this progression:
1. Start with the BUSINESS/PRACTICAL PROBLEM first (e.g., "you want to serve many users efficiently")
2. Probe for CONSTRAINTS and what's WASTEFUL about naive approaches (concrete numbers help)
3. Let me discover the OBSTACLE that motivates the innovation (e.g., "different lengths break batching")
4. Only THEN dive into the technical solution details
5. Use CONCRETE EXAMPLES with small numbers early and often (e.g., "3 users, max 12 tokens")
6. Ask for QUANTITATIVE reasoning when possible (e.g., "what ratio of waste?", "how many blocks?")
7. Progress from PROBLEM → NAIVE SOLUTION → OBSTACLE → BETTER SOLUTION
8. When I seem lost, give a smaller concrete example rather than more abstract explanation

CODE INTEGRATION:
- Suggest writing code snippets at natural points to make concepts concrete
- Start with type definitions and function signatures before implementations
- Build up from pure functions over simple data structures
- Test against concrete small examples (e.g., 3 users, 10 blocks) before scaling up

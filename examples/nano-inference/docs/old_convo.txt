I see you're looking at two nano/minimal vLLM implementations! These are stripped-down versions of the vLLM serving framework. Let me help you understand these through discovery.
Before we dive into the code, let's start with the core problem these projects are solving:
The Original Puzzle:
You have a large language model and want to serve it to multiple users making requests. The naive approach - loading the model once and processing requests sequentially - is painfully slow.
What's the fundamental bottleneck when you try to serve an LLM to multiple concurrent users with the standard transformers library approach?
Think about what happens at the hardware level when user A is halfway through generating a response and user B sends a new request. What resources are sitting idle, and why?RetryCi guess we could start serving B's request as well, but we might not because we're waiting for A to finish. so there might be some gpu memory we're not utilizingExactly! You've identified the key insight - the GPU has unused memory and compute while waiting for A's sequential generation. Now let's dig deeper into why this happens.
When generating tokens for user A, what does the GPU actually spend most of its time doing? Consider that for each new token, you need to:

Run the forward pass through all model layers
Sample the next token
Append it to the sequence
Repeat

Here's the critical question: If your GPU has 24GB of memory and your model takes 13GB, what's happening with the remaining 11GB during generation? And even more importantly - when you run the forward pass for a single sequence, what percentage of the GPU's compute units (SMs/CUs) are actually being utilized?
Think about the shape of the computation: You have one sequence of length N going through matrices of size [hidden_dim, hidden_dim]. What determines how "full" your GPU is during this matmul?RetryCoh yeah we're doing something like BLD -> [1, L, d_model]
when really we could be adding to the batch dimPerfect! You've hit the core insight. Now you're thinking like the vLLM designers did.
So we want to go from [1, L, d_model] to [B, L, d_model] where B is multiple users' requests. But here's where it gets tricky...
User A might be at token position 100 (already generated 100 tokens) while User B just started and is at position 1. Their sequences have different lengths!
If you try to naively batch them together, what problems do you run into? Think about:

The KV cache - what shape does it need to be for each user?
The attention mask - how do you prevent User B from attending to User A's tokens?
The positional encodings - what position values does each user need?

What's your first instinct for how to handle these different-length sequences in the same batch?RetryCi'm not sure, could you maybe ask a more fundamental question, or elaborate with intermediate values/concrete example?Good call - let's make this concrete with actual numbers.
Let's say you have two users:

User A: "What is the capital of France? The capital is Paris, which"  (already generated up to "which")
User B: "Hello"  (just started)

User A has 12 tokens so far. User B has 1 token.
Now, in a standard transformer, when you process a sequence, you compute attention scores between every token and every previous token. For User A's next token generation, you need the Key and Value vectors for all 12 previous tokens stored somewhere.
Here's the fundamental question: Where are those Key and Value vectors stored between generation steps?
And follow-up: If User A has 12 tokens worth of K,V vectors stored, and User B has 1 token worth, what shape would a "batch" of these be? Can you even make a regular tensor out of sequences of length 12 and 1?
Try sketching out what shape tensors you'd need:

User A's keys: [?, ?, ?]
User B's keys: [?, ?, ?]
Combined batch: [?, ?, ?]
RetryCi dont think we can make a tensor out of these sequences of different lengths without padding. and if we don't batch it we're at square 12 / 2Exactly! You've identified the core dilemma. We need batching for efficiency, but different lengths break tensors.
So here's what the early LLM serving systems did - they just padded! User B's sequence becomes "Hello [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]..." up to length 12.
But think about what happens at the GPU computation level when you do this padding approach:
When computing attention for User B's next token, the GPU still has to:

Compute Q @ K^T for all 12 positions (even though 11 are padding)
Apply softmax over 12 values (with mask to zero out 11 of them)
Compute attention @ V for all 12 positions

What's the ratio of useful work to wasted work for User B in this example? And what happens to this ratio if User A is at position 1000 while User B just started?
More importantly: Is there a way to physically rearrange how we store these sequences in memory so we don't need padding at all?RetryChm i might not understand the kv cache well enough to answer thatPerfect - let's build up the KV cache from scratch! This is essential to understand before we can grasp vLLM's innovation.
Let's start with the absolute basics. When you generate token #5 for a sequence, you need to compute attention between token #5 and tokens 1,2,3,4.
The attention formula is: Attention = softmax(Q @ K^T) @ V
For token #5:

Q comes from token #5's embedding (shape: [1, d_model])
K comes from tokens 1,2,3,4 (shape: [4, d_model])
V comes from tokens 1,2,3,4 (shape: [4, d_model])

Now here's the key question: When you move on to generate token #6, you'll need K and V for tokens 1,2,3,4,5.
Where do the K,V vectors for tokens 1,2,3,4 come from this time? Do you:
a) Recompute them from scratch by running tokens 1,2,3,4 through the model again?
b) Load them from somewhere you saved them?
And if (b), what's the computational trade-off you're making? What resource are you spending to save what other resource?RetryCwe should spend memory to save time. so instead of recomputing we can load K and V for each level, for each token positionExactly! You're trading memory for compute. This is the KV cache - we store all past K and V vectors to avoid recomputation.
Now let's get concrete about the storage. For a model with:

32 layers
d_model = 4096
Generating 100 tokens

You need to store:

K vectors: 32 layers × 100 positions × 4096 dims = ~13M values
V vectors: 32 layers × 100 positions × 4096 dims = ~13M values
Total: ~26M fp16 values = ~52MB per sequence

So here's the critical question for batching different-length sequences:
User A has generated 100 tokens (needs 52MB of KV cache)
User B has generated 10 tokens (needs 5.2MB of KV cache)
In a standard implementation, these KV caches are stored as tensors:

User A: [32, 100, 4096] for K, same for V
User B: [32, 10, 4096] for K, same for V

Can you see why these can't be trivially combined into a batch? And what would happen if you tried to pad User B's cache to match User A's size?
More importantly: What if instead of storing each user's KV cache as a contiguous tensor, you stored something else... what's the minimum unit of KV data you actually need to track?RetryCthe minimum would be one token3 / 3Brilliant! Each token's KV vectors are the atomic unit. This is the key insight that unlocks everything.
So instead of storing User A's cache as one big [32, 100, 4096] tensor, you could store it as 100 separate chunks of [32, 1, 4096] - one chunk per token.
Now here's where it gets interesting. If you're managing memory at the token level rather than the sequence level, you need some kind of bookkeeping system to track which chunks belong to which user.
Think about this like a memory allocator. You have a big pool of KV cache "blocks" (each block holds one token's KV data). When User A generates token #101, you need to:

Allocate a new block from the pool
Store token #101's KV data there
Remember that this block belongs to User A's sequence

What data structure would you use to track which blocks belong to which user's sequence? And crucially - how would you tell the attention mechanism where to find all the KV blocks for a given user when computing their next token?
Consider that during attention, you need to gather all of User A's 100 blocks (which might be scattered anywhere in memory) to compute Q @ K^T.RetryCi guess we could just use a hashmap, and we coudl index on (user, token_pos, layer_idx)You're on the right track with the hashmap idea! But let's think about the performance implications of your indexing scheme.
When computing attention for User A's next token at layer 15, you need to retrieve ALL previous token positions (0 through 99) for layer 15. With your scheme (user, token_pos, layer_idx), you'd need 100 separate hashmap lookups!
Let's think about what we're actually accessing together:

When computing layer 15's attention for User A, we need all of User A's KV vectors at layer 15
These get used in a single matrix multiplication: Q @ K^T

So here's a better question: Instead of tracking individual tokens in the hashmap, what if we tracked slightly bigger chunks? What's the natural "unit of work" in attention computation that we always access together?
Also consider: If these KV blocks might be scattered all over GPU memory, how do we efficiently gather them into a contiguous tensor for the matmul? Would the hashmap live on CPU or GPU?
Think about it this way: You have a bookkeeping problem (which blocks belong to which user) and a memory layout problem (how to efficiently access those blocks). How might you separate these concerns?RetryCper layer? not sure if i know what you mean by the 'unit of work'Let me clarify with a concrete example!
When computing attention at layer 15 for User A's next token, here's what actually happens:

You compute Q (query) for the new token: [1, num_heads, head_dim]
You need ALL previous K vectors for User A at layer 15: [100, num_heads, head_dim]
You do Q @ K^T to get attention scores: [num_heads, 1, 100]
After softmax, you multiply by V vectors: [100, num_heads, head_dim]

The "unit of work" I'm getting at: You always need ALL of a user's tokens together for a given layer. You never need just token 37 by itself.
But here's the real challenge - and this is what vLLM solves cleverly:
If User A's 100 KV blocks are scattered randomly across GPU memory (addresses like 0x1000, 0x5000, 0x2000, 0x9000...), the GPU has to do 100 random memory reads to gather them for the attention computation. Random memory access is SLOW on GPUs.
So we have two conflicting requirements:

We want to allocate/deallocate KV blocks flexibly as sequences grow/shrink
We want contiguous memory access for efficient attention computation

How would you reconcile these? Is there a way to get both flexibility AND contiguous access?
Hint: Think about the difference between "logical" position and "physical" position. What if the order in memory didn't match the order in the sequence?RetryCwait i thought that we didnt want to grab things together because user B might have some K/V values that overlap with user A? maybe we should write some pseudocode to make more concrete what we're thinking aboutExcellent idea! Let's write pseudocode to clarify. I think we might be talking past each other on what "overlap" means.
Let me first show you the naive approach, then we'll see the problem:
python# Naive padding approach
def generate_next_token_padded(users_requests):
    # Say User A has 100 tokens, User B has 10 tokens
    max_len = 100
    batch_size = 2
    
    # KV caches padded to same size
    K_cache = torch.zeros(batch_size, n_layers, max_len, n_heads, head_dim)
    V_cache = torch.zeros(batch_size, n_layers, max_len, n_heads, head_dim)
    
    # User A's data at positions 0-99, User B's at 0-9, rest is padding
    K_cache[0, :, :100, :, :] = user_A_keys
    K_cache[1, :, :10, :, :] = user_B_keys
    # ... same for V
    
    # Problem: User B wastes 90 positions of computation!
Now, what I think might be causing confusion - User A and User B don't share KV values. Each user has their own completely separate KV cache. The question is how to store them efficiently.
Can you write pseudocode for how you think the token-level block allocation might work? Just focus on:

How would you allocate a new block when a user generates a token?
How would you track which blocks belong to which user?
How would you gather them for attention?
RetryCthat feels like a kind of large task can i get a smaller oneGood call! Let's start with just the allocation part.
Here's a concrete scenario:

You have a GPU memory pool that can hold 1000 KV blocks
Each block stores KV for one token (across all layers)
User A has already allocated blocks 0, 1, 2 for their first 3 tokens
User B has already allocated blocks 3, 4 for their first 2 tokens

Now User A generates their 4th token. You need to store its KV vectors.
Simple question: Which block number should you allocate for User A's 4th token?
And follow-up: What information do you need to track so you can later retrieve all of User A's blocks (0, 1, 2, and the new one) when they generate token #5?
Just sketch the data structure - something like:
pythonblock_pool = [... what goes here? ...]
user_blocks = {... what goes here? ...}RetryCblock_pool = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
user_blocks = {a: [0,1,2,5], b: [3,4]}Perfect! You've got it. User A gets block 5, and you track the mapping. This is exactly the core idea behind vLLM's PagedAttention.
Now here's the key insight about why this design is clever:
Look at User A's blocks: [0, 1, 2, 5] - they're NOT contiguous in memory! Block 5 could be physically far from blocks 0,1,2.
When you need to compute attention for User A's next token, you have to gather blocks from positions 0, 1, 2, 5 in the pool. That's 4 separate memory reads from potentially scattered locations.
But here's the thing: GPUs hate random memory access but love batched operations. So vLLM does something clever...
What if instead of thinking of it as "gather User A's blocks", you think of it as "process multiple blocks in parallel"?
Look at this pattern - when Users A and B both need attention computed:

Need blocks: [0, 1, 2, 5] for A and [3, 4] for B
Total blocks needed: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Do you see what we could do here? Instead of two separate gather operations, what if we processed all needed blocks in one operation? What would that look like?RetryCwe can grab all of 0,1,2,3,4,5 and then we can distribute the computed values to the correct positions to return in streaming?Yes! You're getting the batching insight. We can grab all blocks in one operation. But let me help you see the specific clever trick vLLM uses.
When we grab blocks [0,1,2,3,4,5], we get a tensor of shape [6, n_layers, n_heads, head_dim] for the K cache.
Now for the attention computation:

User A needs to compute their query against blocks [0,1,2,5]
User B needs to compute their query against blocks [3,4]

Here's the key question: In standard attention, you do Q @ K^T where K contains all the keys. But now our K tensor has blocks from BOTH users mixed together.
How do you prevent User A's query from attending to User B's blocks (3,4) and vice versa?
Think about what the attention mask would need to look like. If we stack the queries into:

Row 0: User A's query
Row 1: User B's query

And the keys are ordered as blocks [0,1,2,3,4,5], what should the mask matrix be?
        Blocks: 0  1  2  3  4  5
User A:        [?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?]
User B:        [?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?]
Fill in 1 for "should attend" and 0 for "should not attend".RetryCBlocks: 0  1  2  3  4  5
User A:        [1  1  1  0  0  1]
User B:        [0  0  0  1  1  0]so we're basically using this in addition to the causal mask? 2 / 2Exactly! You've discovered PagedAttention's core mechanism. This "block mapping mask" works alongside the causal mask.
Now let's think about the actual implementation. You have two types of indexing happening:

Physical: Blocks 0,1,2,3,4,5 in the memory pool
Logical: User A wants positions 0,1,2,3 (which map to physical blocks 0,1,2,5)

Here's the beautiful part: This same mechanism solves another problem. What if User A says "Actually, regenerate from token 50 onward with temperature 0.8 instead"?
With the traditional approach (one big contiguous tensor per user), what would you have to do to handle this request?
But with your block pool design where user_blocks = {a: [0,1,2,...,49,50,51,...,99]}, what could you do instead? How many blocks need to be deallocated vs kept?
This touches on why these projects call it "paged" attention - think about how virtual memory works in operating systems. What's the analogy here?RetryCi actually dont know how virtual memory works in operating systems. but in my block pool design i can just set regen_a_user_blocks = user_blocks[a][:50]2 / 2Perfect! You got it - you just keep blocks 0-49 and deallocate 50-99. Those freed blocks immediately become available for other users. This is way more efficient than copying or managing huge tensors.
Let's connect this to why it's called "paged" attention. The OS virtual memory analogy is actually really helpful here:
In operating systems, your program thinks it has one big contiguous array of memory (addresses 0 to N). But physically, that memory is broken into fixed-size chunks called "pages" (usually 4KB each). The OS maintains a "page table" that maps logical addresses to physical addresses.
Your program asks for address 10000, but that might actually be stored at physical address 85000. The program never knows - it just uses logical addresses.
See the parallel?

Your blocks = OS pages
Your user_blocks dict = page table
User A thinks they have positions [0,1,2,3...] = logical addresses
But they're actually stored in blocks [0,1,2,5...] = physical addresses

Now here's a question that leads to the next optimization:
You have 1000 blocks total. User A is generating token by token. When should you allocate a new block for them - right when they need it, or in advance? What are the trade-offs?
And what happens if all 1000 blocks are full and User C arrives with a new request?RetryCuser a is generating token by token, i guess we can allocate blocks in advance, since they've probably passed us a max_tokens param, and then we can free anything un-used if it gets interrupted. but this is prone to over-preallocating. maybe we pre-allocate in common/space efficient chunks like powers of 2.Excellent thinking! You're anticipating the memory fragmentation and allocation strategy problems.
The pre-allocation in chunks is smart, but let me push you on one detail: powers of 2 are great for general memory allocators, but is there something specific about LLM generation that might inform a better chunk size?
Think about it: What's the typical pattern of token generation?

Input prompt: 50 tokens all at once
Generation: 1 token, 1 token, 1 token...

So you have two distinct phases. Here's the key question: During the "prefill" phase (processing the initial prompt), do you even need to store KV cache blocks the same way as during generation?
Consider:

Prefill: Process tokens 0-49 in parallel, one forward pass
Generation: Process one token at a time, need KV cache from all previous

What optimization opportunity do you see here? When would you actually need to "commit" those KV blocks to the block pool?
And here's a harder question: If you're processing a batch of 10 users all in prefill phase with different prompt lengths (30, 50, 20 tokens...), how might you handle that differently than 10 users all in generation phase?RetryCoh i see, during prefill we can allocate all the blocks at once, and then during generation we can do the chunksYes! You've got the phase distinction. During prefill you know exactly how many blocks you need upfront.
But here's an even deeper insight you're close to discovering:
During prefill for a 50-token prompt, you compute all 50 tokens' K and V vectors in one forward pass. They're already in a nice contiguous tensor of shape [50, n_layers, n_heads, head_dim].
Do you actually need to split this into 50 separate blocks immediately? Or could you... keep it as one big chunk during prefill and only "page it out" to blocks when you start generation?
Think about the memory access patterns:

Prefill: You always access all 50 tokens together (for the self-attention)
Generation: You access all previous tokens for each new token

This leads to vLLM's actual design: Copy-on-Write (CoW) semantics. The same 50-token chunk can be shared by multiple sequences until one of them needs to modify it (by generating new tokens).
Here's a scenario: You're doing beam search with beam_size=3. All three beams share the same 50-token prompt. In the block pool design:

Naive approach: Allocate 50×3 = 150 blocks
CoW approach: Allocate 50 blocks, shared by all 3 beams

What happens when beam 1 generates token 51 but beams 2 and 3 go in different directions? Which blocks need to be copied and which can stay shared?RetryCi dont know what copy on write means, is it worth discovering2 / 2Yes, absolutely! CoW is a fundamental optimization pattern that appears everywhere - from operating systems to databases to vLLM. Let's discover it from first principles.
Here's the concrete scenario:
You're serving a chatbot. A user sends: "Explain quantum physics"
You want to generate 3 different responses (for variety) using temperature sampling. All three responses start with the same prompt "Explain quantum physics" (let's say 4 tokens).
Initially:

Response A: "Explain quantum physics"
Response B: "Explain quantum physics"
Response C: "Explain quantum physics"

Naive approach: Store 3 copies × 4 tokens = 12 blocks of KV cache.
But wait - they're all IDENTICAL at this point. What if instead you stored:

Physical storage: 4 blocks containing KV for "Explain quantum physics"
Logical mapping: A points to blocks [0,1,2,3], B points to [0,1,2,3], C points to [0,1,2,3]

All three responses share the same physical blocks! Now generation begins:

Response A generates: "using"
Response B generates: "through"
Response C generates: "with"

What needs to happen to the block mappings now? Can A, B, and C still share blocks [0,1,2,3]? What about their new 5th tokens?RetryCyeah we can still share 0,1,2,3 but we can't share the 5th token.Exactly! So now you have:

Blocks [0,1,2,3]: Shared KV for "Explain quantum physics"
Block [4]: KV for "using" (A's token)
Block [5]: KV for "through" (B's token)
Block [6]: KV for "with" (C's token)

The mappings become:

A → [0,1,2,3,4]
B → [0,1,2,3,5]
C → [0,1,2,3,6]

This is "Copy-on-Write" - you only create copies when someone needs to "write" (modify/extend). The name is a bit misleading here since we're not modifying existing blocks but appending new ones. The principle is the same: share until you can't.
Now here's where this becomes incredibly powerful:
Imagine you're serving a popular chatbot and 100 users all send slight variations of "Write a Python function to sort a list". The prompt preprocessing might tokenize to the same first 8 tokens for many of them.
Without CoW: 100 users × 8 tokens = 800 blocks
With CoW: 8 blocks + (divergence points)
What percentage of your KV cache have you just saved? And what does this mean for how many concurrent users you can serve?
But here's the implementation challenge: How do you track which blocks can be safely freed? If User A abandons their session, when can you deallocate block 4 but NOT blocks [0,1,2,3]?RetryCwe need everyone to end session before we can free [0,1,2,3]. so we need to have the count of the users using each block? 2 / 2Perfect! You've invented reference counting. Each block needs a counter:
pythonblock_pool = {
    0: {"data": KV_tensors, "ref_count": 3},  # A,B,C all using it
    1: {"data": KV_tensors, "ref_count": 3},
    2: {"data": KV_tensors, "ref_count": 3},
    3: {"data": KV_tensors, "ref_count": 3},
    4: {"data": KV_tensors, "ref_count": 1},  # Only A
    5: {"data": KV_tensors, "ref_count": 1},  # Only B
    6: {"data": KV_tensors, "ref_count": 1},  # Only C
}
When User B ends their session, you decrement ref_count for blocks [0,1,2,3,5]. Block 5's count hits 0, so it's freed. Blocks [0,1,2,3] stay alive because A and C still need them.
Now you understand the core memory management of vLLM! Let's connect this back to the actual repos you're looking at.
Looking at the nano-vllm implementations - they're trying to implement these concepts in minimal code. The key files you'll want to examine:

Where they define the block/page structure
How they track the block assignments (their version of user_blocks)
The attention kernel that uses the block mapping mask we discovered

Which of these would you like to dig into first? Or is there a specific part of the code that's confusing you?RetryCwhats in nano vllm that we haven't covered yetGreat question! Let's see what other core pieces these nano implementations have that we haven't explored yet.
The main things we haven't covered:

Continuous Batching - We talked about batching different users, but not the scheduling policy. Here's the puzzle: Users A, B, C are generating tokens. User D just arrived with a new request. User A is about to finish (hit EOS token). When do you add User D to the batch? Do you wait for A to finish, or can you add D immediately?
The Actual CUDA Kernel - We figured out the block mapping mask, but how do you efficiently implement that scattered memory gather on GPU? The attention computation needs to read non-contiguous blocks.
Preemption - You have 1000 blocks all allocated. A high-priority request arrives. Which user do you kick out, and how do you save their state to resume later?
Quantization Integration - How does this block design work when your KV cache is quantized to int8 or int4 to save memory?
Prefill/Decode Disaggregation - Can you run prefill on one GPU and generation on another?

Which of these feels most mysterious to you? Or is there something in the actual code structure of those repos that doesn't map to what we've discussed?
For example, if you look at their scheduler or block manager code, what stands out as confusing?RetryCi guess what im trying to do is reimplement as much of vllm as possible over time. so for example, we might mock parts of the structure to write valid python code that can show how the block scheduler works, in isolation. and then we can dig into the remaining improvements and slowly 'unmock' parts of the systemlets do something functional, so we should think about the types/problem shape and function signatures first. to start, we can implement the block manager we just chatted about, and then we can start talking about the other improvements? 3 / 3Excellent approach! Let's build a functional block manager from scratch. Starting with types and signatures is exactly the right way to think about this.
Let me guide you to discover the design. First, what are the core entities we need to model?
Think about what we've discussed:

Blocks that hold KV cache data
Users/sequences that own references to blocks
The operations we need to support

Here's my question to get you started: What's the minimal set of operations our block manager needs to support? Think about the lifecycle of a user's request:

User sends a prompt → ?
Model generates a token → ?
User abandons request → ?
(Special case) Multiple sequences share a prompt → ?

For each of these, what method would you need on the block manager? And more fundamentally - what information does the block manager need to track?
Try sketching out just the type definitions and method signatures first:
python@dataclass
class Block:
    # What goes here?
    pass

class BlockManager:
    def __init__(self, num_blocks: int):
        # What data structures do we need?
        pass
    
    # What methods?
What's your instinct for the minimal API?RetryCi want pure functions over our types, classes shouldn't have methods. 
i'll start by writing out the data structures, and then we can abstract over it?i think we obviously need user_block_map : Dict[str, List[Int]]don't tell me what im missing, validate/push back on what i have now, then we can continuei guess we need the reference counts. so maybe what we actually want isblock_map : List[List[str]] # map from indices to owners[['a', 'b'], ...]we need to efficiently: find a empty blockfor a given user, get the maskso we want user_block_map for step 2, and for step 1 the block_map3 / 3Good start! Let me push back on your block_map : List[List[str]] design.
Think about the operations you need:

When user 'b' ends their session, you need to remove 'b' from potentially many blocks
When checking if a block can be freed, you just need to know if anyone is using it

With your List[List[str]] design:

Removing user 'b' requires iterating through every block's list and removing 'b' - that's O(n*m) where n is blocks and m is users per block
To check if block is free, you check if the list is empty - that works

But here's my challenge: You said you need to "find an empty block efficiently". With your structure, how do you find one? Do you scan through all blocks until you find one with an empty list?
What if you have 10,000 blocks and only block #9,999 is free? How many operations to find it?
Also consider: Do you actually need to know WHO owns each block, or just HOW MANY owners there are? What's the minimal information needed for your operations?RetryCi guess we can just say how many owners there are, and then we can store a pointer alongside about where the first free block is?Yes! Reference counts are sufficient. But think about the "pointer to first free block" idea...
What happens in this sequence:

First free block is #5
Allocate block #5 to user A
Now first free block is #8
User B (who owned block #2) ends their session
Block #2 becomes free

Where does your "first free block" pointer point now? Still #8? But #2 is available and comes before it!
How do you handle freed blocks that come "before" your pointer?
And here's another question: When you need to allocate 5 blocks for a new user, you need to find 5 free blocks quickly. What data structure naturally handles this pattern of "give me an available item" and "return this item to the pool"?
Think about what data structures you know that have O(1) insert and remove...RetryChashset2 / 2Close! A hashset gives you O(1) insert/remove, but how do you "get an arbitrary free block" from a hashset? You'd need to iterate to find one.
Think simpler - what if you kept all free block indices in a list and just:

Pop from the end when allocating
Append when freeing

pythonfree_blocks = [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 999]  # Initially all free
block = free_blocks.pop()  # O(1) allocate
free_blocks.append(block)  # O(1) free
But wait, there's a subtlety here. With reference counting and multiple users potentially sharing blocks, when exactly can you add a block back to the free list?
Let's make this concrete:

Block #7 has ref_count = 3 (users A, B, C share it)
User A finishes, ref_count becomes 2
User B finishes, ref_count becomes 1
User C finishes, ref_count becomes 0

At which step do you free_blocks.append(7)? And what does this tell you about the relationship between ref_counts and free_blocks?RetryCwe can free_blocks.append(i) when refcount[i] == 0Exactly! So you have a clear invariant: a block is in free_blocks if and only if ref_counts[i] == 0.
Now let's design the pure functions. Based on our discussion, here's what we need to track:
pythonfrom typing import List, Dict, Set

# Our core state
BlockManagerState = {
    'ref_counts': List[int],      # ref_counts[i] = number of users sharing block i
    'free_blocks': List[int],      # indices of blocks with ref_count == 0
    'user_blocks': Dict[str, List[int]]  # user_id -> list of block indices
}
Now, what pure functions do we need? Start with allocation. What should the signature be?
pythondef allocate_blocks(state: BlockManagerState, user_id: str, num_blocks: int) -> tuple[BlockManagerState, List[int]]:
    # Returns (new_state, allocated_block_indices)
    pass
But wait - what should happen if num_blocks > len(state['free_blocks'])? Should we:

Return an error?
Partially allocate what we can?
Something else?

And here's a trickier question: We talked about copy-on-write. Should allocate_blocks handle the case where you're sharing existing blocks (incrementing ref_counts) versus allocating fresh ones? Or should those be separate functions?
What's the clearest API in your mind?RetryCcan we make a type instead of the Dict? i want @dataclass
class BlockManagerState
    ref_counts: List[int]
    free_blocks: List[int]
    user_blocks: Dict[str, List[int]]for allocate_blocks, we return new_state and allocated_indices. if num_blocks > len(state['free_blocks']), maybe we actually want to make some kind of queue ??Perfect, dataclass is cleaner! And you're onto something important with the queue idea.
When there aren't enough blocks, you've discovered that we need to handle waiting. In real vLLM, this is where request scheduling comes in. But let's keep it simple for now - we can return None or raise an exception if we can't allocate.
Here's the more interesting design question: For copy-on-write (sharing blocks), we have two distinct operations:

"Share these existing blocks with a new user" (increment ref counts)
"Allocate fresh blocks for new tokens"

Should we have:
pythondef allocate_blocks(state: BlockManagerState, user_id: str, num_blocks: int) -> tuple[BlockManagerState, List[int]]:
    # Always allocates fresh blocks
    pass

def share_blocks(state: BlockManagerState, user_id: str, block_indices: List[int]) -> BlockManagerState:
    # Increments ref_counts for existing blocks
    pass
Or combine them:
pythondef allocate_blocks(state: BlockManagerState, user_id: str, num_fresh: int, shared_indices: List[int] = []) -> tuple[BlockManagerState, List[int]]:
    # Handles both
    pass
Which feels cleaner? Think about the typical usage pattern:

Beam search: "Share blocks 0-49 from user A with new beam B, then allocate 1 fresh block for B's first generated token"

What's your preference?RetryCwe can have allocate_blocks call into fresh blocks vs share blocks helpers? 2 / 2Perfect! Composing from smaller functions is the functional way. Let's build it up:
python@dataclass
class BlockManagerState:
    ref_counts: List[int]
    free_blocks: List[int]
    user_blocks: Dict[str, List[int]]
Now write the helper functions. Start with the simpler one - sharing existing blocks:
pythondef share_blocks(state: BlockManagerState, user_id: str, block_indices: List[int]) -> BlockManagerState:
    # What needs to happen here?
    # 1. Update ref_counts for each block in block_indices
    # 2. Update user_blocks to record that user_id owns these blocks
    pass
Try implementing it. But here's a subtle question: What if user_id already exists in user_blocks? What if they already own block 5 and you're trying to share block 5 with them again?
And for the state update - since we want pure functions, you need to return a new state. Will you deep copy everything or can you be smarter about it?RetryCto be clear, can you give me the example high level input/state that we're going to be testing our code against? 2 / 2Absolutely! Let's create a concrete scenario to test against:
python# Initial state: 10 blocks total, all free
initial_state = BlockManagerState(
    ref_counts=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    free_blocks=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    user_blocks={}
)

# Scenario: Chatbot serving multiple users
# Step 1: User A sends "Explain quantum physics" (takes 4 blocks after prefill)
state1, blocks_a = allocate_fresh_blocks(initial_state, "user_a", 4)
# Expected: blocks_a = [9, 8, 7, 6] (or any 4 blocks)
# state1.user_blocks = {"user_a": [9, 8, 7, 6]}
# state1.ref_counts[9] = 1, ref_counts[8] = 1, etc.
# state1.free_blocks = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Step 2: User B wants beam search with width=2 on same prompt
# Beam B1 shares A's prompt blocks
state2 = share_blocks(state1, "beam_b1", [9, 8, 7, 6])
# state2.ref_counts[9] = 2, ref_counts[8] = 2, etc (shared!)
# state2.user_blocks = {"user_a": [9,8,7,6], "beam_b1": [9,8,7,6]}

# Beam B2 also shares A's prompt blocks  
state3 = share_blocks(state2, "beam_b2", [9, 8, 7, 6])
# state3.ref_counts[9] = 3 (shared by A, B1, B2)

# Step 3: Each beam generates different next tokens
state4, new_b1 = allocate_fresh_blocks(state3, "beam_b1", 1)  # B1 generates "using"
state5, new_b2 = allocate_fresh_blocks(state4, "beam_b2", 1)  # B2 generates "through"

# Step 4: User A finishes and releases
state6 = release_blocks(state5, "user_a")
# state6.ref_counts[9] = 2 (now only B1, B2 share it)
# state6.ref_counts[8] = 2, etc.
# A's blocks NOT freed yet because still shared!

# Step 5: Beam B1 finishes  
state7 = release_blocks(state6, "beam_b1")
# Blocks 9,8,7,6 still not freed (B2 still using them)
# But B1's unique generation block IS freed

# Step 6: Beam B2 finishes
state8 = release_blocks(state7, "beam_b2")
# NOW blocks 9,8,7,6 finally freed (ref_count = 0)
Does this give you enough to implement and test against?RetryCwell really we should be calling allocate_blocks() every time, and allocate_blocks should be routing to fresh or share internally? 2 / 2You're absolutely right! Let's fix the API. The caller shouldn't have to know about the internal distinction between fresh and shared blocks.
So the scenario becomes:
python# Initial state: 10 blocks total, all free
initial_state = BlockManagerState(
    ref_counts=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    free_blocks=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    user_blocks={}
)

# Step 1: User A sends "Explain quantum physics" (4 blocks for prefill)
state1, blocks_a = allocate_blocks(initial_state, "user_a", num_fresh=4, shared_indices=[])
# Returns blocks_a = [9, 8, 7, 6]

# Step 2: Beam B1 shares A's prompt, needs no fresh blocks yet
state2, blocks_b1 = allocate_blocks(state1, "beam_b1", num_fresh=0, shared_indices=[9,8,7,6])
# Returns blocks_b1 = [9, 8, 7, 6] (same as A's)

# Step 3: Beam B1 generates a token, needs the shared blocks PLUS one fresh
state3, blocks_b1_extended = allocate_blocks(state2, "beam_b1", num_fresh=1, shared_indices=[9,8,7,6])
# Returns blocks_b1_extended = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5] (shared + one fresh)
Wait, this reveals a problem! In step 3, beam_b1 already owns [9,8,7,6]. Do we:

Pass them again as shared_indices (seems redundant)?
Just pass num_fresh=1 and append to existing blocks?
Track this differently?

What's the cleaner API here? Should allocate_blocks be aware of what the user already owns?RetryCi think that allocate_blocks should be responsible for knowing what to do right? like allocate_blocks should find out, for each index that we need, figure out if we need fresh blocks, and if not, allocate sharedAh, I see what you're thinking! But I think there's a conceptual mismatch. Let me ask you this:
When would allocate_blocks know that it should share existing blocks versus allocating fresh ones?
Think about these two very different scenarios:

Beam search initialization: "Create beam_b1 that starts from user_a's sequence"
New user: "Create user_c with a brand new request"

In both cases, if you just call allocate_blocks(state, user_id, num_blocks=4), how does the function know whether to:

Share user_a's blocks (scenario 1)
Allocate 4 fresh blocks (scenario 2)

The function can't decide this on its own - it's the caller who knows the semantic intent. The caller knows "this is a beam search fork" vs "this is a new request".
So what information does the caller need to pass to make their intent clear?
Think about it: what's the minimum the caller needs to specify for the block manager to do the right thing?RetryCuser id?The user_id alone isn't enough! Both beam_b1 and user_c are new user_ids that the block manager has never seen before. How would it know that beam_b1 should share from user_a, while user_c should get fresh blocks?
Think about what the caller actually knows at the moment they're creating a new sequence:
Scenario 1 (beam search): "I'm creating beam_b1 as a fork of user_a at position 4"
Scenario 2 (new user): "I'm creating user_c with a fresh prompt of 4 tokens"
The key information is: which blocks (if any) should be shared?
So the caller needs to specify:

The new user_id
Which existing blocks to share (could be empty)
How many fresh blocks needed

That leads us back to something like:
pythondef allocate_blocks(state, user_id, shared_from=None, num_fresh=0):
    # shared_from could be another user_id to copy from
    # or shared_indices could be explicit block numbers
What makes most sense as the API? How would the caller specify "fork from user_a" vs "start fresh"?RetryCturn off roleplay, are we doing this correctly or going down a weird path? how does nano vllm engine actually work2 / 2You're right to check - we're actually overcomplicating it. Let me clarify how the actual nano vLLM engine works:
In real vLLM, the block manager doesn't handle the "forking" logic directly. Instead:

Sequences have their own identity and track their blocks
The Scheduler decides when to fork/share (for beam search)
The Block Manager just handles allocation/deallocation

The actual flow is:

Each sequence has a logical_token_blocks list (which logical blocks it needs)
The block manager maintains physical_blocks and a mapping from logical→physical
Copy-on-write happens at the logical→physical mapping level

Looking at the nano-vllm code, the key abstractions are:

Sequence - tracks tokens and logical blocks
BlockTable - maps logical blocks to physical blocks
BlockManager - just allocates/frees physical blocks

The API is simpler:
python# Block manager just knows:
def allocate() -> Optional[PhysicalBlock]  # Get a free block
def free(block_id: int) -> None  # Return a block

# The sequence/scheduler layer handles:
def fork_sequence(parent_seq_id, child_seq_id)  # Copy logical→physical mappings
So you were right to feel we were going down a complex path. The block manager should be dumber - it just manages a pool. The intelligence about sharing lives at the sequence scheduling layer.
Want to simplify and implement the actual design instead?RetryCyeah, but lets go back into socratic mode. perhaps we should start a new chat? include the socratic prompt and any links that the new claude should reference (probably the nano vllm link)2 / 2You're right - we've built up a lot of context here and it would be cleaner to start fresh now that you understand the core concepts of KV cache blocking and paging.
Start a new chat with this prompt:
"I'm trying to understand and reimplement the vLLM block manager design from https://github.com/GeeeekExplorer/nano-vllm. I understand the basic concept that KV cache is divided into blocks that can be shared between sequences for memory efficiency.
I want to implement a minimal version starting with just the block manager. Can you help me discover the right abstractions and implementation through Socratic questioning? I want to focus on the actual design used in nano-vllm, not overcomplicate it.
Let's start with understanding what data structures and functions we need for a basic block allocator."
This will let you dive directly into the implementation with the right context, without all our exploratory dead-ends. The new conversation can focus on:

The clean separation between physical block pool and logical→physical mapping
How the BlockTable abstraction works
The actual sequence forking mechanism
How this integrates with attention computation

This way you'll build the real design from first principles without our false starts around having the block manager handle sharing logic directly.

goal: 

be able to write search(corpus, text) and get back nearest neighbors/distance/something


[ ] basic data collect
[ ] download small chunk of C4/similar
[ ] chunk into sentences/paragraphs/something
[ ] save as jsonl 
[ ] print to verify it worked

[ ] embed chunks (sentence-transformers or BERT or something)
[ ] save embedded chunks as numpy arrays or something

[ ] build a function to search a given query text and return top k

[ ] test by embedding sentence known in training data, get itself as nearest neighbor + vice versa (get a sentence we know is not in data)

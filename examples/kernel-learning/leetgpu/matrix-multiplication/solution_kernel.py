Matrix Multiplication

Difficulty: EASY
Challenge ID: 2
Language: cute

Write a program that multiplies two matrices of 32-bit floating point numbers on a GPU.
  Given matrix \(A\) of dimensions \(M \times N\) and matrix \(B\) of dimensions \(N \times K\), compute
  the product matrix \(C = A \times B\), which will have dimensions \(M \times K\).
  All matrices are stored in row-major format.


Implementation Requirements

  Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
  The solve function signature must remain unchanged
  The final result must be stored in matrix C


Example 1:

Input:
Matrix \(A\) (\(2 \times 2\)):
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1.0 & 2.0 \\
3.0 & 4.0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Matrix \(B\) (\(2 \times 2\)):
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
5.0 & 6.0 \\
7.0 & 8.0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Output:
Matrix \(C\) (\(2 \times 2\)):
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
19.0 & 22.0 \\
43.0 & 50.0
\end{bmatrix}
\]


Example 2:

Input:
Matrix \(A\) (\(1 \times 3\)):
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1.0 & 2.0 & 3.0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Matrix \(B\) (\(3 \times 1\)):
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
4.0 \\
5.0 \\
6.0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Output:
Matrix \(C\) (\(1 \times 1\)):
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
32.0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The "Ray-Ready" Design Checklist

  If you follow these principles, adding Ray later costs ~1 week instead of ~4-6 weeks:

  ✅ Design Principles

  1. Use Protocols, Not Concrete Classes
    - Define TrainingBackend, InferenceEngine, Storage protocols
    - Swap implementations without changing caller code
  2. Async by Default
    - Use async/await for I/O operations
    - Ray works great with async code
  3. Message Passing, Not Shared Memory
    - Use Queue, asyncio.Queue for communication
    - No global mutable state
  4. Dependency Injection
    - Pass dependencies to __init__, don't create them
    - Makes testing AND Ray distribution easier
  5. Serializable Configuration
    - Use @dataclass with JSON serialization
    - Ray needs to serialize config to workers
  6. Abstract Storage
    - Don't assume local filesystem
    - Use a Storage protocol
